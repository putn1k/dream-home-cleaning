                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Regular Vacuuming </div>
                <div>The first step to maintaining your car interior is regular vacuuming. Invest in a handheld vacuum or use the vacuum attachments in your household vacuum to remove surface dirt, dust, and debris from the seats, carpets, and floor mats. Regular vacuuming prevents dirt from settling deep into the fabric and helps keep your interior looking clean.</div>

                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Wipe Down Surfaces</div>
                <div>Frequently wipe down the dashboard, steering wheel, door panels, and other surfaces with a microfiber cloth. This helps remove dust, fingerprints, and grime that can accumulate over time. Use a mild interior cleaner or a mixture of water and mild soap for stubborn stains. Avoid using harsh chemicals that can damage the interior.</div>

                <div>Frequently wipe down the dashboard, steering wheel, door panels, and other surfaces with a microfiber cloth. This helps remove dust, fingerprints, and grime that can accumulate over time. Use a mild interior cleaner or a mixture of water and mild soap for stubborn stains. Avoid using harsh chemicals that can damage the interior.</div>

                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Clean Spills Immediately</div>
                <div>Accidental spills happen, but it's crucial to clean them up immediately. Use a clean cloth or paper towel to blot the spill, then use a mild cleaner or upholstery spot cleaner to remove any stains. Waiting too long can allow liquids to seep into the fabric or upholstery, making stains more challenging to remove.</div>

              <li>
                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Use Seat Covers and Floor Mats </div>
                <div>Protect your car seats and carpets from wear and tear by using seat covers and floor mats. These accessories act as a barrier against spills, dirt, and debris, making it easier to clean and maintain your car's interior. Choose high-quality, easily washable covers and mats for added convenience.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Avoid Eating and Smoking in the Car </div>
                <div>Minimizing food consumption and smoking in your car can significantly reduce the risk of stains, lingering odors, and damage to the interior. Food crumbs and cigarette smoke can leave unpleasant smells and create difficult-to-remove stains. Keep your car interior fresh and clean by refraining from these activities inside the vehicle.</div>
