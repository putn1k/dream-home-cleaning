                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Regular Vacuuming </div>
                <div>Regular vacuuming is the foundation of carpet maintenance. Aim to vacuum your carpets at least once or twice a week, depending on foot traffic. This helps to remove loose dirt, dust, and allergens, preventing them from settling deep into the carpet fibers.</div>

                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Immediate Stain Removal</div>
                <div>When accidents happen and spills occur, act swiftly. Blot the stain gently with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb as much liquid as possible. Avoid rubbing vigorously, as this can make the stain spread. Once blotted, treat the stain with a suitable carpet stain remover according to the manufacturer's instructions.</div>

                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Use Doormats</div>
                <div>Prevention is key to carpet maintenance. Place doormats at the entrances to your home to trap dirt and debris before it reaches your carpets. Encourage family members and guests to wipe their shoes thoroughly before stepping onto the carpeted areas.</div>

                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Avoid Sun Exposure</div>
                <div>Direct sunlight can fade and damage carpets over time. Use curtains, blinds, or window film to protect your carpets from excessive UV exposure. If possible, rotate the position of furniture and rugs to ensure even sunlight distribution and prevent uneven discoloration.</div>

                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Implement a No-Shoes Policy</div>
                <div>Encourage a no-shoes policy or provide indoor slippers for household members and guests. Shoes can track in dirt and grit from outside, which can cause premature wear and tear on your carpets. Removing shoes at the entrance will help to keep your carpets cleaner for longer.</div>

                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ol-title">Rotate Furniture </div>
                <div>Consider periodically rotating your furniture to distribute the weight and traffic on your carpets evenly. This helps to prevent the formation of permanent indentations and prolong the life of your carpet fibers.</div>
