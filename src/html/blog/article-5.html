            <p>When it comes to keeping our homes pristine, upholstery cleaning plays a vital role in maintaining a clean and healthy living space. If you've ever wondered how cleaning companies in Dubai determine the cost of cleaning upholstery, you've come to the right place. In this article, we will pull back the curtain and explore how Dream Home, a renowned cleaning company in Dubai, forms the cost of cleaning upholstery based on three key factors: size of the furniture, level of contamination, and general condition of the upholstery.</p>

          <div class="col-12 col-xl-6">
            <p>At Dream Home, we understand that upholstery comes in various sizes and shapes, each requiring a different level of effort and resources to clean thoroughly. To ensure fairness and accuracy in our pricing, we consider the size of the furniture. Larger pieces may require more time, cleaning solutions, and equipment to complete the job effectively. By factoring in the size, we can determine the appropriate cost for cleaning your upholstery, ensuring transparency and consistency for our customers.</p>

                <h2 class="title-sm">The level of contamination</h2>
                <p>Over time, dust, dirt, stains, and other contaminants can accumulate on upholstery, diminishing its appearance and potentially causing health issues. Dream Home considers the level of contamination when determining the cost of the cleaning process. Heavily soiled or extensively stained upholstery may require additional treatments, specialized cleaning methods, or extra cleaning agents. By evaluating the level of contamination, we can provide an accurate estimate that aligns with the amount of work needed to restore your upholstery to its original glory.</p>

                <h2 class="title-md">The general condition of the upholstery</h2>
                <p>The general condition of the upholstery is another critical factor in forming the cost of cleaning. Older or more damaged upholstery may require extra care and attention to remove embedded dirt, repair minor damages, or rejuvenate faded colors. Our trained professionals at Dream Home assess the condition of your upholstery to create a customized cleaning plan that addresses the specific needs of your furniture effectively. By evaluating the general condition, we can provide an honest estimate that reflects the effort and expertise required to provide top-notch cleaning results.</p>
