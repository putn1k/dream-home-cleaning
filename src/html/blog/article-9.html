                <div>To tackle ink stains on your sofa, apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol or non-acetone nail polish remover to a clean cloth. Gently blot the stain, being careful not to rub it, as this may spread the ink. Continue blotting until the stain lifts. Once the stain is gone, dab the area with a cloth dampened with water to remove any residue. Allow the area to air dry.

                <div>When faced with food or drink spills on your sofa, act quickly to prevent the stain from setting. Start by blotting the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb as much liquid as possible. Mix a small amount of dish soap with water to create a soapy solution. Dip a clean cloth into the solution, wring out any excess liquid, and gently blot the stain. Avoid rubbing, as this may push the stain deeper into the fabric. Once the stain is removed, use a clean cloth dampened with water to rinse the area. Blot with a dry cloth to absorb excess moisture and allow the sofa to air dry.

                <div>For pet-related stains and odors, begin by blotting up as much liquid as possible using a clean cloth. Mix a solution of white vinegar and water in equal parts. Apply the solution to the stained area and blot gently. This will help neutralize the odor. Then, sprinkle baking soda over the stain and let it sit for about 15 minutes to absorb any remaining odor. Vacuum the baking soda and inspect the area. If the stain persists, repeat the process or consider using a specialized pet stain remover.

                <div>To tackle grease and oil stains on your sofa, start by blotting the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to remove any excess grease. Sprinkle baking soda or cornstarch over the stain and let it sit for a few minutes to absorb the grease. Use a vacuum cleaner to remove the baking soda or cornstarch. If the stain remains, mix a small amount of mild dish soap with water to create a soapy solution. Dip a clean cloth into the solution, wring out any excess liquid, and gently dab the stain. Rinse the area with a clean cloth dampened with water and blot dry.
