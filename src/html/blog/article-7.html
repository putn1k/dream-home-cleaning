                <div class="title-sm custom-article__ul-title">Test for Colorfastness</div>
                <div>To ensure that the curtain colors won't bleed or fade during cleaning, it's essential to perform a colorfastness test. Dampen a small, inconspicuous area of the curtain with the cleaning solution and gently dab it with a white cloth. If there is no color transfer, you can proceed with cleaning the entire curtain.

                <div>If there are any noticeable stains on the curtains, treat them individually before proceeding with the full cleaning. Apply a small amount of the cleaning solution to a clean cloth and gently blot the stain. Be careful not to scrub vigorously, as this may damage the fabric. Continue blotting until the stain fades.

                <div>Submerge the curtains into the prepared cleaning solution and gently agitate them. Let them soak for 15-20 minutes. Then, use your hands to rub the fabric gently, paying extra attention to areas with stains or visible dirt. Rinse the curtains thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.

                <div>After rinsing, squeeze out excess water from the curtains without wringing or twisting them. Hang the curtains back on their rods or hooks to air dry. Avoid placing them in direct sunlight, as it can cause fading. Allow ample time for the curtains to dry completely before rehanging.
